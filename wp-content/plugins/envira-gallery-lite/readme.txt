We believe that you shouldn't have to hire a developer to create a WordPress gallery. That's why we built [Envira](https://bit.ly/35gNvqW), a drag & drop **photo gallery plugin** that's both EASY, FAST and POWERFUL.

Envira is highly optimized for web and server performance because we understand the importance of speed when it comes to image and gallery load times, as well as SEO and conversion.

> <strong>Envira Pro</strong><br />
> Photo Gallery by Envira is the lite version of the popular Envira Pro plugin that comes with all the features you will ever need including albums, tags, social media integration, gallery templates / gallery layouts, deeplinking, pagination, e-commerce, image proofing, and tons more.

**Envira** has been downloaded over 2,100,000 times. Here's why smart photographers, designers, and developers love Envira, and you will too!

= Drag & Drop Gallery Builder =

We were tired with the bloated and buggy gallery widgets. That's why we built Envira Gallery to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create in minutes. By using our easy to use [drag and drop builder](https://bit.ly/3bObn87), you can upload your photos, rearrange them, and create an image gallery with just a few clicks.

You can also add gallery blocks built for the new WordPress 5.0 Gutenberg block editor.

> The trick to making difficult things easy is to keep the easy things still easy. <strong>Envira makes everything easy.</strong> If you've struggled with WordPress gallery plugins that take video tutorials to learn, you're going to love Envira Gallery.<br>
> Chris Lema - WordPress Blogger and Speaker

= Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed =

Envira is 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed.

Plus, you have the ability for meta data, deeplinks, standalone galleries, and pagination.

= Sharing and Selling Photos Made EASY =

Social media integrations, image proofing, and WooCommerce store integration.

> Not only is Envira <strong>exceptionally well built</strong> behind the scenes, it's also exceptionally easy to use. It's perfect for those who really want to get things done.<br>
> Pippin Williamson - WordPress Core Contributor and founder of EasyDigitalDownloads

= Easy to Customize and Extend =

You can easily customize with our built-in wordpress templates or create your own.

But we also knew that our developer friends may want to extend it further. That's why Envira comes with tons of hooks and filters (and yes it's all very-well documented).

> Most WordPress gallery options are either too basic or require a PhD to figure out. For my clients, I need something that is easy to use yet powerful. Envira is the answer. Its straight forward approach means it is a breeze for my clients to quickly create galleries. Nevertheless, with the API and documentation available, it also allows developers to make customizations and extend functionality when necessary. Simply put, <strong>Envira is a great tool</strong> for everyone's tool chest.<br>
