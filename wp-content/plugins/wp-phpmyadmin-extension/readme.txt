= Plugin Description =
The famous database browser & manager (for MySQL & MariaDB) - use it inside WordPress Dashboard without an extra hassle.

== NOTES ==
* PHP >= 7.1.3 is required to for <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> latest version (otherwise you will have option to use older version of PMA, which is not encouraged for usage).
* This plugin has been started from 2018 year, and we have no relations to the old age's (from 3rd party scammers) vulnerable <b>wp-phpMyAdmin</b> plugin. This plugin is just a wrapper for official phpMyAdmin release and depends itself on the realiability & security of the `phpMyAdmin` itself. Also, initially we wanted to put PhpMyAdmin release `.zip` file (with same checksum, to ensure the checksums are same) to unpack that .zip directly upon plugin's installation, but unfortunately WordPress.Org plugin team didn't allow to put `.zip` file in the package (saying that SVN doesn't like .zip files), so, we had to submit original PMA (untouched) to the repository.
* For the reason to make it compact, some extra files (language files, etc) are removed.

= Available Options =
