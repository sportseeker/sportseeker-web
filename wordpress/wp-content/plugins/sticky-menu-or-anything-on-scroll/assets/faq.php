<p><strong><?php _e('Q: I selected a class/ID in the settings screen, but the element doesn\'t stick when I scroll down. Why not?','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></strong><br />
<?php _e('First, make sure that if you select the element by its classname, it is preceded by a dot (e.g. ".main-menu"), and if you select it by its ID, that it\'s preceded by a pound/hash/number sign (e.g. "#main-menu").  Also, make sure there is only ONE element on the page with the selector you\'re using.

<p><strong><?php _e('Q: Once the element becomes sticky, it\'s not positioned/sized properly at all.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></strong><br />
<?php _e('Due to the nature of CSS, there are situations where an element will not stick properly, usually if it has specific properties that are used to manipulate its location and/or dimensions. If your sticky element has any of the following properties, this could cause conflicts:</p><ul><li>- negative margins</li><li>- absolute positioning</li><li>- top/left/bottom/right properties</li><li>- "display: inline"</li><li>- "!important" applied to any of its properties</li></ul><p>Try to avoid all this where possible, but if you can\'t, using the plugin in Legacy Mode (see below) helps sometimes.<br>Another situation that can cause trouble, is when any parent of your sticky element has the "transform" CSS property applied to it.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>

<?php _e('If you\'re using the plugin in Legacy Mode (see below), this happens when the sticky element (or any of its contents) has a CSS transition applied to it.

<?php _e('The current version only allows one sticky element, but this functionality will be implemented in the next major version. No expected release date, though.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>

<p><strong><?php _e('Q: What is Legacy Mode? Should I use it?','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></strong><br />
<?php _e('In version 2.0 of the plugin, a new/better method for making elements sticky was introduced. Before this, a sticky element would essentially be a cloned copy of the original element.

<p><?php _e('So, should you use it or not? Well, if you <em>upgraded</em> this plugin from an earlier version, Legacy Mode will be turned ON by default, because chances are that the old method worked perfectly fine for your site. If that\'s the case, there is not really a need to use the new method and you can just continue using the old, classic method. If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it, right?','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('Having said that, it\'s worth checking if your element works just as well with Legacy Mode turned OFF, since this is the "better" method. Just give it a quick try. If it doesn\'t work, you can always just go back and enable it again.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('<span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: new installs of the plugin will have the Legacy Mode turned off by default. Only UPGRADES from 1.4 (or before) should have it turned on by default.</span>','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>

<p><strong><?php _e('Q: What is this Dynamic Mode thing exactly?','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></strong><br />
<?php _e('This mode is only available in Legacy Mode, and to properly explain this, we\'ll need to go a little deeper in the plugin\'s functionality. So bear with me...','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('In Legacy Mode, when an element becomes sticky at the top of the page (and keeps its place regardless of the scrolling), it\'s actually not the element itself you see, but a cloned copy of it, while the actuak original element is out of view and invisible.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('The original element always stays where it originally is on the page, while the cloned element is always at the top of the browser viewport screen. However, you will never see them both at the same time; depending on your scroll position, it always just shows either one or the other.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('In the original plugin version, the clone would be created right the moment when you load the page (but not visible right away). Then when you would scroll down, it would become visible (and stick at the top), while the original element would disappear from view.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('However, some themes use JavaScript to dynamically create elements (menus, mostly) for mobile sites. With this method, a menu doesn\'t exist in the HTML source code when you load the page, but is created some time after the page is fully loaded -- in many cases, these menus would just be generated ONLY when the screen is more (or less) than a certain specific width. With the original version of the plugin, the problem would be that the original element (that you want to make sticky) may not have been fully created upon page load, so the clone would also not be fully functional.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('Enter Dynamic Mode. Now, a clone of the element is not created on page load -- instead, it\'s only created when the user scrolls and hits the "sticky" point. This ensures that the cloned element is an actual 1-on-1 copy of what the original element consists of at that specific point in time (and not at the "page is loaded" point, which may be different if the element was altered since).','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('Why don\'t we use Dynamic Mode all the time then? This has to do with the fact that other plugins initialize themselves on page load and may need the full markup (including the cloned element) at that point. In Dynamic Mode, there is no clone available yet on page load, so that could cause an issue if that other plugin is looking for an element that doesn\'t exist yet.','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
<p><?php _e('(This may all sound terribly confusing. And it is! So, much work was done to fix this nonsense: since v2.0 of the plugin, a whole different method is being used to make elements sticky, and Dynamic Mode is not even an issue anymore.)','sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll'); ?></p>
